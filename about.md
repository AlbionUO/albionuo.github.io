## Supported with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.

A great way to learn it is looking at the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
